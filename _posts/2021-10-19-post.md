title: Today, we start to blog

Students in the class will use these blogs to record impressions of online exhibits that they visit.

The first site that we will visit is the [Gagosian Gallery](https://gagosian.com/).
I visited Damien Hirstâ€™s End of a Century in this art gallery. It shows the exploration of life and death through artworks, such as the formalin series.
